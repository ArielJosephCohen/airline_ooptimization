Customer satisfaction on flights.

***

# Project Goals
The goal of this project is to build a model to predict customer satistfaction accurately and find key factors in determining customer satisfaction.

***

# Business Value
The business value of this project will be to help airlines better understand how to best serve their customers and what areas they should focus on and invest time and money into for customer satisfaction and conversely what they need to spend less money on (if possible, I'd also like to explore cost-benefit analysis. After we know what factors of a flight matter most to customers, we could see which ones actually have a high likelihood or potential to actually be implemented).

# Analytical Process and Statistical Methods Employed

From a simplistic perpspective, I want to explore all flights initially but later hone in on domestic and international flights in particular to see if there are major or important differences.

1. To accomplish this I will organize the data and later conduct exploratory data analysis and hypothesis tests to gain further insights into my data which may lead me to organizing the data again in new and more creative ways.

2. Next, I will leverage feature engineering to optimized the inputs in my data and search for new possible inputs implicit in the data.

3. I will then split my data into a training and test set for modeling purposes.

4. I will then leverage various machine learning calssficiation algorithms without much focus placed on hyperparameters to train and test various models. I will then look at the performance, implied metrics, and feature importance from these models.

5. Afterward, I will look for ways to customize the models and further optimize inputs using methods such as feature selection and grid search (determining optimal model parameters). I will also implement a quick neural network (for entertainment purposes primarily). Following this step I will again look at feature importance, implied metrics, and updated model performance.

5. At this point, I may export my data to a visualization software in order to more easily view and process results.

6. Finally, I will make my recommendations

# Data and Source

* The features present are satisfaction (binary), age, gender, customer type, travel type, class, departure delay, arrival delay, and flight distance.

* The following features are all represented numerically with 0 being bad and higher numbers being better: seat comfort, departure and arrival time convenience, food and drink, gate location, wi-fi service, entertainment, online support (before flight), ease of online booking, on-board service, leg room, baggage hadling, check-in service, online boarding, cleanliness.

* My data comes from kaggle.com and can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/sjleshrac/airlines-customer-satisfaction).
